## Design
This term library supports the following kinds of terms:

- Constructor application terms (`ApplTerm`)
- String terms (`StringTerm`)

- Real value terms (`RealTerm`)
- List terms (`ListTerm`)
- Term variables (`TermVar`)

### List terms
List terms can be implemented as cons-nil lists, or as arrays.
